**MediaSonic** is the default music and media player for **SynOS**, designed from the ground up as a beautiful, tactile, and immersive alternative to modern media applications. Built with the spirit of the Atmo design language and a deep respect for human-centric interaction, MediaSonic aims to make listening to music and watching videos a deeply engaging and joyful experience.

Currently in very early alpha, MediaSonic is a work in progress and is being actively developed to reflect the core philosophy of Syndromatic: clarity, charm, and control.

## üöß Project Status

    ‚ö†Ô∏è MediaSonic is currently in very early alpha.
    While the application compiles and basic playback is functional, many components such as full metadata integration, playlist management,
    and advanced view modes (like Cover Flow) are incomplete or experimental.
    Retina display support is also currently a work in progress.

Expect bugs, unfinished features, and rough edges. We welcome collaboration and testing, but this is not yet ready for daily use.

## üß† Philosophy & Goals
MediaSonic is more than just a media player. It's a statement against the sterile, flat, and ephemeral nature of modern software. We believe that interacting with your music and video library should be a personal and delightful experience, not just a utility. It's about bringing back the feeling of holding an album in your hands, the joy of a dedicated music machine, and the sense of ownership over your collection.

As a cornerstone of the SynOS Atmo design language, MediaSonic will continue to evolve into a full-featured, skeuomorphic, and deeply human media experience that respects both the art it plays and the person listening.
